i prefer to imagine that prince now communicates with the outside world solely via his own gold-plated telegraph machine .
russia actually had a plan to do the same at the same time we wanted to nuke the moon , but never went through with it either .
chet fucking steadman - the rocket
i think s / he means in population , not land mass .

well snippety-doo-da
a friend from sri lanka said that his father went to europe in the 70 ' s and traded oil in exchange for abba albums . imagine that happening today
it was fairly well accepted at the time with buchanan . some people also suspect lincoln , but in his case it was more than likely a romantic friendship since
yum !

for science !
hodor
are you fucking kidding me with this shit ? you just learned this ?
totally worth it .
when people kill themselves by sticking their head in the oven , they are not cooking their heads to death , they are inhaling the gas .
oh i forgot about the character who martin clearly and undauntedly killed off in adwd . man that sure was a conclusive death !
